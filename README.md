# Retro_Nokia_Snake_Game

Retro Nokia Snake Game using Raspberry Pi Pico made with ‚ù§ by Siddhartha Rakshit

Very much inspired from the childhood memories, when we used to play "The Snake Game" in our good old nokia phones, I bet most of us scored a huge. So let's recall the some part of childhood with this project.

## Circuitry and Coding Part
- Follow the Schematic and connect the OLED Display and Push Button switches 
- The OLED Display is an I2C based 128x64 pixels display, you can use any other monochrome OLED display of your choise.
- After connecting all the components use the (/i2c.py) code to check whether the diaplay is connected properly or not.
